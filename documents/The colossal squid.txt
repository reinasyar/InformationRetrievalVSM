The colossal squid, Architeuthis dux, is a legend among deep-sea creatures. With an estimated length of up to 18 meters (60 ft) and eyes the size of dinner plates, it is the largest known invertebrate.  Despite its immense size, very little is known about this elusive creature.  The vast majority of information about the colossal squid comes from dead specimens that have washed ashore or been captured by trawlers.  These encounters are rare, and scientists are only beginning to understand the colossal squid's behavior and ecology.

One of the most fascinating aspects of the colossal squid is its giant beak.  This parrot-like beak is located at the front of the squid's mantle and is used to tear apart prey.  The beak of a colossal squid can be up to 40 cm (16 in) long and is strong enough to crush bones.  The squid's tentacles are also formidable weapons.  They are lined with suckers that are equipped with sharp hooks.  These hooks allow the squid to grip onto prey and tear it to shreds.

The colossal squid is a solitary creature that lives in the deep ocean depths, where sunlight never reaches.  It is believed to be an apex predator, feeding on a variety of prey, including fish, sharks, and even other squid.  The squid's powerful beak and tentacles allow it to capture and kill even large prey.
