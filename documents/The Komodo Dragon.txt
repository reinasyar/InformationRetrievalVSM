The Komodo dragon (Varanus komodoensis) is the largest living lizard species.  These massive reptiles can grow up to 3 meters (10 ft) in length and weigh up to 70 kg (150 lb).  Komodo dragons are found only on a few islands in Indonesia, including Komodo, Rinca, Flores, and Gili Motang.  They are apex predators in their environment and play an important role in the island's ecosystem.

Komodo dragons are carnivorous and eat a variety of prey, including deer, pigs, water buffalo, and even other Komodo dragons.  They are ambush predators and will lie in wait for prey to come close before attacking.  Komodo dragons have a powerful bite and their saliva contains a potent venom that can kill prey.  The venom is not strong enough to kill a large animal outright, but it can cause the animal to become weak and disoriented.  The Komodo dragon will then follow the prey until it dies and then eat the carcass.

Komodo dragons are solitary creatures and only come together to mate.  The female Komodo dragon lays up to 30 eggs in a nest.  The eggs incubate for about eight months, and the young hatchlings are independent from birth.  Komodo dragons can live for up to 50 years in the wild.

These fascinating creatures are a popular tourist attraction.  However, Komodo dragons are listed as vulnerable on the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species.  Habitat loss and hunting are the main threats to the Komodo dragon population.  Conservation efforts are underway to protect these unique animals.
