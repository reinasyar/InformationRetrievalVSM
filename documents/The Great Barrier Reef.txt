The Great Barrier Reef is the world's largest coral reef system composed of over 2,900 individual reefs and 900 islands stretching for over 2,300 kilometres (1,400 mi) over an area of approximately 344,400 square kilometres (133,000 sq mi). The reef is located in the Coral Sea, off the coast of Queensland, Australia. The Great Barrier Reef can be seen from outer space and is the world's biggest single structure made by living organisms. This reef structure is composed of and built by billions of tiny organisms, known as coral polyps. It supports a wide diversity of life and was selected as a World Heritage Site in 1981. CNN labelled it one of the seven natural wonders of the world.

Coral reefs are underwater ecosystems held together by calcium carbonate secreted by tiny marine animals called coral polyps.  These polyps are related to anemones and jellyfish.  They cluster in groups and secrete a hard calcium carbonate skeleton, forming colonies called coral reefs.  Coral reefs provide a habitat for a wide diversity of marine life.  Fish, sea turtles, dolphins, sharks, and many other creatures find food and shelter among the coral's intricate branches.

The Great Barrier Reef is an important economic asset for Australia.  Tourism generates billions of dollars in revenue each year.  The reef also protects the coastline from erosion and provides food for many fish species.  However, the Great Barrier Reef is facing a number of threats, including climate change, pollution, and overfishing.  These threats are causing the coral to bleach and die.  If these threats are not addressed, the Great Barrier Reef could disappear within a few decades.
