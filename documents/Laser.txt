Lasers (Light Amplification by Stimulated Emission of Radiation) are a type of light that is different from ordinary light in several ways.  Ordinary light is made up of waves of different lengths and frequencies.  These waves travel in all directions from the source, and they can be scattered by objects in their path.  Laser light, on the other hand, is monochromatic, meaning it has a single wavelength and frequency.  This makes laser light highly coherent, which means that the waves are all in phase with each other.  Laser light is also collimated, meaning that the waves travel in a very narrow beam.

The properties of laser light make it useful for a wide variety of applications.  Lasers are used in medicine for surgery, to remove tumors, and to treat a variety of other conditions.  They are also used in industry for cutting, welding, and marking materials.  Lasers are used in communications to transmit information over long distances.  They are also used in scientific research to study the properties of matter and light.

The invention of the laser in 1960 is considered one of the most important technological breakthroughs of the 20th century.  Lasers have revolutionized many fields and continue to be developed for new applications.
